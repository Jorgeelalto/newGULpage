# The new GUL webpage
Static, simple and following the [material design guidelines](https://material.io/) as much as possible (taking into account we are engineers, not designers).

In each folder there is a README.md file with a bit of information about its contents, TODO notes, and other stuff.

## Color palette

This is the color palette used in the whole page. You can find the hexadecimal values of each one at the beginning of [style.css](style.css)
